## Description:
The Turtle Crossing Game is a fun and interactive game where the player controls a turtle and tries to cross a busy road filled with cars. The goal is to reach the other side without getting hit by any cars. As the player progresses, the level increases, making the game more challenging.

This project demonstrates object-oriented programming in Python and utilizes the turtle graphics module for creating game elements and the random module for generating cars.

## Features
- The player can control the turtle using the Up key to move forward.
- Cars are randomly generated and move from right to left across the screen.
- The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.
- The level increases each time the turtle successfully crosses to the other side.
- The score is displayed on the screen, showing the current level.
